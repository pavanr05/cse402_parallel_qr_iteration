# Numerical methods to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices

This objective of the project is to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices using iterative numerical methods. OpenMP and MPI will be used to parallelize the operations. The code was run on the Campus Cluster at UIUC.

## Packages needed

* CMake (Version 3.5 or above)
* A C++ compiler
* OpenMP
* MPI
